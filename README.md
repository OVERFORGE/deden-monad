🏠 Decentralized Den (DeDen) – Web3 Pop-Up Stay Platform
World’s First Web3 Pop-Up Stay Experience • Built on Monad • Pay in USDC/USDT
🚀 About DeDen

Decentralized Den (DeDen) is the world’s first Web3 pop-up stay ecosystem, designed to bring founders, developers, creators, and Web3 natives under one roof during major global blockchain events.

We host premium co-living stays around the biggest Web3 conferences — a place where people not only sleep, but build, brainstorm, and network 24/7.

This version of the platform is deployed on Monad, enabling fast, low-cost, and seamless on-chain payments.

🧩 Key Features

🏡 Pop-Up Web3 Stays:
Curated luxury villas & co-living spaces around major events (IBW, Breakpoint, Devcon, Hackathons, etc.)

💳 On-Chain Payments (Monad):
Users can book stays using USDC or USDT on Monad RPC — fast, cheap, secure.
